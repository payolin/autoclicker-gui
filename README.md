# simple-autoclick
A simple autoclicker program made with python using tkinter and pynput modules

---Installation---
 1. Make sure tkinter and pynput modules are installed (A compiled version wil be uploaded soon to avoid that dependency)
 2. Click on code > download zip > extract it or clone the repository

---Usage---
1. Run main.py
2. When you click on "Start autoclicker", the program will start running.
3. Press the activation key, and the program will toggle clicking automatically.
4. Pressing "esc" (this will probably change in the future) or clicking "Stop" will stop the program.
5. You can change activation key, delay, and click type when the program is not running.


---Known Bugs---
- Clicking "change activation key" causes a not responding issue on Windows (works as intented in Linux)

---TODO---
- Disable setting entries when program is running
- Implement a total click counter
